====================
OVERVIEW
====================
Kripke is a simple, scalable, 3D Sn deterministic particle transport code.  
Its primary purpose is to research how data layout, programming paradigms and 
architectures effect the implementation and performance of Sn transport.  
A main goal of Kripke is investigating how different data-layouts affect 
instruction, thread and task level parallelism, and what the implications are 
on overall solver performance.



====================
REQUIRMENTS
====================
CMake 2.8 or later
C++ Compiler (g++, icpc, etc.)
MPI 1.0 or later
Python 2.7 or later



====================
BUILDING
====================
Setup uses CMake, so first create a build subdirectory inside the Kripke 
root directory:

	mkdir kripke-Linux

Go into that directory and run CMake:

  cd kripke-Linux
	cmake ..

Now make Kripke:

  make -j8
  
Now you have built Kripke, try running the test harness:
  
  ./src/tools/kripke --test
  
====================
BUILDING ON BG/Q (VULCAN)
====================
Setup build directory

      mkdir kripke_BGQ

Go into that directory and run CMake:

  cd kripke_BGQ
      /usr/local/tools/cmake-2.8.11.2/bin/cmake  .. -DENABLE_tcmalloc=OFF -DENABLE_OPENMP=OFF

(This has been configured without tcmalloc and without OpenMP)

Now compile:
   make -j8

The executable is:
   src/tools/kripke


====================
FURTHER RESOURCES
====================
You can look at the source code and the user manual included in the tarball 
for further information.
