====================
OVERVIEW
====================
Kripke is a simple, scalable, 3D Sn deterministic particle transport code.  
Its primary purpose is to research how data layout, programming paradigms and 
architectures effect the implementation and performance of Sn transport.  
A main goal of Kripke is investigating how different data-layouts affect 
instruction, thread and task level parallelism, and what the implications are 
on overall solver performance.



====================
REQUIRMENTS
====================
CMake 2.8 or later
C++ Compiler (g++, icpc, etc.)
MPI 1.0 or later
Python 2.7 or later



====================
BUILDING
====================
A setup script is provided to aid in setting up a build space.
Run the setup script, and specify your MPI C++ compiler:

  CXX=mpig++ ./setup.py

This will setup a build space, for example "./kripke-Linux".
Go into that directory and run make

  cd kripke-Linux
  make -j8
  
Now you have built Kripke, try running the test harness:
  
  ./src/tools/kripke --test

FURTHER RESOURCES
====================
You can look at the source code and the user manual included in the tarball 
for further information.
